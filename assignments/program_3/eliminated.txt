//ProgramName: Program-3
//Author: Conner Chamberlain
//Description: 
//This program reads in animal names into a doubly-linked
//list. It then prompts the user to enter a number that will
//serve as the random number seed. It then prompts the user
//to enter a number that acts as the multiplier. If the
//number is even, the pointer moves to the right and vice
//versa. Animals are then removed based on the random number
//until one animal is left. This animal is then declared the
//winner (the animal names are read in from a .txt file).
//This is all made possible from the class with methods
//for checking conditions and loops to initiate said methods
//in main.cpp.
